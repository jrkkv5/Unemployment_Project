#loads the necessary packages

```
First we need to load the libraries that we will be using into our report. The above code should load the proper libraries. R Studio will prompt you to install the packages if necessary.


``` {r log variables}
merged_final <- read_csv("csv files/mergedFinal.csv")
#Reads final file into merged dataframe

merged_final$log_pop = as.numeric(log(merged_final$population))

merged_final$log_RMHI = as.numeric(log(merged_final$RMHI))
```
As a final step in scrubbing our data, we created new variables to log the population and median household income variables and store it in our dataframe. By taking the logarithmic values, these variables become more comparable to the existing variables we have within our dataset.

Below you can see the table output once all of our data has been merged.
``` {r merged_final_table}

kable(merged_final[1:6,], caption = "Table Including All Variables")
```

The dependent variable, value, has a mean of 5.44 and a standard deviation of 1.97. Connecticut and Virginia had the lowest unemployment rate in 2000 at 1.8, while West Virginia was the highest in 1984 at 14.4. The mean HPI was 260.15, with a standard deviation of 119.68. The lowest HPI was found in Wyoming in 1987 at 79.25, while the highest was in Massachusetts in 2018 at 796.86. Poverty rate had a mean of 12.85 and a standard deviation of 3.69. In 1989, Connecticut had the lowest rate of 2.9, and Mississippi had the highest at 27.2 in 1988. The sp500 index mean was 9.48, and the standard deviation was 15.70. In 2008, the lowest index was seen at -38.4, while the highest index was seen in 1995 at 34.11. The logged population mean was 15.06, and the standard deviation was 1.01. Wyoming had the lowest logged population at 13.025 in 1990, California having the highest in 2018 at 17.49. Logged real median household income had a mean of 10.95 and a standard deviation of 0.17. In 2013, Mississippi had the lowest log_RMHI at 10.46, while Massachusetts had the highest in 2018 at 11.37. 

After our data was merged we binned the states into groups based on the mean population of the years in our dataframe (1984-2018).  Below are the bins that were created:

Population < 2,000,000
WV, NM, NE, ID, ME, HI, NH, RI, MT, DE, SD, ND, AK, VT, WY

2,000,000 < Population < 5,000,000
MN, AL, LA, CO, SC, KY, OK, OR, CT, IA, MS, KS, AR, UT, NV

5,000,000 < Population < 10,000,000
MI, NJ, GA, NC, VA, MA, IN, WA, TN, MO, WI, MD, AZ

Population > 10,000,000
CA, TX, NY, FL, PA, IL, OH


Each member of our group performed some basic analysis on the states within one of the bins. After performing our initial analysis we chose to focus on 2 states within each bin.  The states we chose to focus on are: TX, IL, MO, WA, OR, CO, WV, ME


Below are some of the highlights along with commentary for the states we have chosen to focus on

Histograms graphically summarize the distribution of a data set. In Illinois, from 1984 to 2018, The annual unemployment rates ranged from 4.0-11.0%. The histogram displays a positively skewed distribution. An unemployment rate that fell within the first two intervals, 4.0-4.9% & 5.0-5.9% occurred 18 out of the 36 years examined. 

```{r IL Histogram Poverty}

     breaks = 5)
```
In Illinois, from 1984 to 2018, the poverty levels ranged from 9.0-16.0%. The histogram displays a slightly negatively skewed distribution meaning relatively higher poverty rates occurred more often than lower rates. Between 12.0-12.9% was the most frequently recorded interval during this time period. In 14 of the 36 years examined, the poverty rate in Illinois was between 13-15.9%.

A correlation function is used to illustrate the relationship between our independent variable and our dependent variable. The closer the correlation is to 1 or -1 the stronger the correlation between the two variables. For a correlation of 1, it signifies that there is a perfect positive correlation. For a -1 correlation there is a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. 

The correlation between the RMHI and our dependent variable, unemployment, in Illinois is 0.03109792. The correlation shows that there is a weak positive correlation between median household income 

The correlation between HPI (Housing Price Index) and our dependent variable, unemployment, in Illinois is -0.08115831. The correlation shows that there is a weak negative relationship between the housing price index and unemployment. 

The correlation between poverty, the percentage of the population under the poverty line, and unemployment in Illinois is 0.6975789. This correlation shows a much stronger positive relationship between the two variables. As unemployment increases there is a much stronger possibility that the percentage of the population under the poverty line increasing as well. 

The correlation between the population and unemployment in Illinois is 0.02011968. The correlation between population and unemployment is a weak positive correlation. The correlation is extremely close to 0, which signified that there is no direct correlation between the two variables. 

The correlation between the s&p 500 and unemployment in Illinois is 0.03109792. The correlation between the S&P 500 and unemployment is a weak positive correlation. With the correlation being extremely close to 0 it signifies that there is not much of a correlation between the two variables. 

The correlation between the log of the population and unemployment in Illinois is 0.01123117. The correlation between the log of the population and unemployment is extremely close to 0, which signifies there is almost no correlation between the two variables.  

The correlation between the log of median household income and unemployment in Illinois is -0.6602776. The correlation between the log of median household income and unemployment is a strong negative correlation. A strong negative correlation suggests that the two variables move in inverse directions of each other. In this case, -0.66 suggests that there is enough evidence to suggest that in most cases the two variables move in inverse directions of each other due to the proximity of -0.66 to -1 which is a perfect negative relationship.

```
In Texas, from 1984 to 2018, the annual poverty rates ranged from 13.0-20.0%. The histogram is nearly symmetrical meaning most of the values occurred in the near middle of the range. 27 of the 36 years were characterized by poverty rates ranging from 15.0-17.9%. Only 5 years experienced lower rates and only 4 experienced higher rates of poverty.

The correlation between the RMHI and our dependent variable, unemployment, in Texas is -0.5663074. The correlation between median household income and unemployment is a decently strong negative correlation. This is much stronger correlation than was the vase with the previous state of Illinois.

The correlation between the housing price index and unemployment in Texas is -0.4234252 which is a negative correlation. It illustrates a correlation that points towards an inverse relationship between the housing price index and unemployment. 

The correlation between poverty, the proportion of the population under the poverty line, and unemployment in Texas is 0.6719098. The correlation between poverty and unemployment shows a decently strong correlation between the two variables. The positive correlation shows that the variables move in the same direction dependent on the value of the variables.  

The correlation between population and unemployment in Texas is -0.3861266. The correlation between population and unemployment points to a weak inverse relationship. This means that as population goes up, then the unemployment tends to go down. The correlation is not as close to -1 as it is to 0, which shows that there are instances where there is no direct relationship between the two variables. 

The correlation between the S&P 500 and unemployment in Texas is 0.09162901. The correlation between S&P 500 and unemployment is a weak positive correlation. With the correlation being this close to zero it shows that in most cases there is no direct correlation between the two variables. 

The correlation between the log of the population and unemployment in Texas is -0.3941111. The correlation between the log of population and unemployment shows that there is an inverse relationship between the two variables. THe correlation is not the strongest, but does illustrate that in certain cases the two variables do have an inverse relationship. 

The correlation between the log of the median household income and unemployment in Texas is -0.5626285. THe correlation between the log of the median household income and unemployment shows a strong inverse relationship. An inverse relationship suggests that the two variables tend to go in opposite directions of each other. So, for instance, as median household income goes up,then the unemployment tends to go down.

Next, the data we collected is considered a time series as it was measured on an annual basis.  We used the unemployment data that was collected for each state and implemented a time series forecast using the Holt Method.  

Time series data typically contains four components: trend, seasonal, cyclical, and random components.  Trend is represented by the long-term movements in the data series, whether that be upward or downward.  A seasonal component normally represents repetitions that occur within a single year time period, whereas the cyclical component represents long-term trends that are usually a factor the economy.  Typically, seasonal trends are easier to identify than cyclical trends because the time period of the seasonal trend is often known ahead of time.  Random components represent the random and unexplained movements within the time series data.

As our unemployment data is shown on an annual basis, we will be focusing on the trend, cyclical, random components in our analysis.  The type of analysis we have chosen to focus on is labeled the Holt Exponential Smoothing Method.  This method is characterized by incorporating the large upward and downward fluctuations in the series and is most appropriate when the dataset lacks seasonal variation.  We went into greater detail explaining the process that was used on IL, but for the other states we will simply analyze the model and the results.


```{r IL Holt Analysis}

IL_TS <- ts(IL_data$value, start = c(1984), end = c(2018), frequency = 1)
#Stores start, end, and frequency of timeseries data

IL_TData <- window(IL_TS, end = c(2004))
IL_VData <- window(IL_TS, start = c(2005))
#Partitions the training and validation sets
```
In the above section of code, we begin our time series analysis of IL by creating the time series with the TS function.  We set the start and end values of our times series data equal to the time span our data streches and set the frequency equal to one.

Using the window function we partition our dataset into a training set, IL_TData, and a validation set, IL_VData.

```{r IL Holt Analysis User}
IL_HUser <- ets(IL_TData, model = "AAN", alpha = 0.2, beta = 0.15)
summary(IL_HUser)
#Training data set using user based parameters for alpha and beta for smoothing.
```
It is common for practitioners to provide user supplied values for alpha and beta (smoothing parameters) due to the fact that the computer generated values are known to over-fit models where the data performed well in the sample period, but does not exhibit the same performance in the future.  In our data, we will compare both user supplied and computer generated smoothing parameters.  We will then compare the error measures to determine which model is a better fit to our data.  We used an alpha = 0.2 and beta = 0.15 when creating our user supplier parameters model.

The ets function above denotes the error, trend, and seasonality of the training set, respectively. The first letter in the model string represents that we want the error to be additive, the second letter represents that fact that we expect the trend type to be additive, and the third letter represents the fact that we do not intend on incorporating seasonality into our model.


```{r IL Holt Analysis Computer}
IL_HCmp <- ets(IL_TData, model = "AAN")
summary(IL_HCmp)
#Training data set using computer based parameters for alpha and beta for smoothing.
```
By comparing the root mean squared error(RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error(MAPE) we can assess the fitness of the user supplier and computer generate models.  The user supplied model has a higher RMSE and MAPE indicating that the computer generated model provides a better overall fit to our forecast. 

```{r IL Holt Set Forecast}
IL_nV <- length(IL_VData)
IL_fUser <- forecast(IL_HUser, h = IL_nV)
IL_fCmp <- forecast(IL_HCmp, h = IL_nV)
```
The length function above was used to set the number of observations equal to the length of the validation set.
Then the forecast function was used to make a forecast based on the observations in our training set.

```{r IL Holt Analysis User Accuracy}
accuracy(IL_fUser,IL_VData)
```
```{r IL Holt Analysis Computer Accuracy}
accuracy(IL_fCmp,IL_VData)
```
When comparing the accuracy function results we see conflicting results in our validation set.  The test set shows that the RMSE and MAPE of the user generated model provides a better fit for the performance of our data.  Ultimately, we decided to continue the process using the computer generated model, but the user supplied model would work just as well.
  
``` {r IL Holt Forecast}
IL_HFinal <- ets(IL_TS, model = "AAN")
forecast(IL_HFinal, h=1)
```
Finally, we bring everything together with the ets function and forecast the unemployment level for the next period, 2019. The forecast that was generated shows us that the expected value of the Illinois unemployment level in December 2019 is equal to 4.42% based on the trends that were observed in our model.
